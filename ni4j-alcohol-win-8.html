He said that he’s only with me out of pity and that maybe he should break up with me. Fine. Do it. Free me from this alcoholic nightmare. I was gonna be willing to stick it out but you know what, as always, alcohol wins. I’m done. I am done. Now I get to figure out my life.

I have been back at school and in work, have an incredible boyfriend and making relative progress towards a better life, but for some reason I have been compelled to drink myself into oblivion. I felt myself hating alcohol, wishing I was more productive daily, envying people who get up earlier than 10am every day. I watched myself gain about twenty pounds from it. I felt unmotivat.

Someone asked me yesterday if I could detail the ways in which I was able to improve my score by 14 points, so I thought I would write out the gist of my study plan. I'm not sure if this will help anyone (and I'm still pretty fuzzy on how exactly I got the score I did/my heart hasn't stopped pounding since 8 am yesterday) but I figured I have gained so much from this subreddit that I wanted to be able to give back whatever I could :) Score Progression: I took my diagnostic.

I moved to a new city almost a month ago. The condition of the apartment I rented was much different, worse, than I was led to believe. I’m talking mold and bugs. Even still I was happy to be there, so I went about town and took a few selfies (don’t judge lmao). They were from my first day here before I immediately relapsed. Even though the apartment sucks, I still had such light in my eyes.

I just past my 3 week mark and I know my worst struggles are ahead of me but I really mean it when I say I am not going to drink anymore.

The weekend has come and I have been good for the past few days, trying to get my mind of the thought of having a drink, and it has come and gone. Typically my weekend (and everyday) would start around 4 pm after I get off work and head to the liquor store on the way home to pick up a pint of cheap vodka and a gatorade chaser. And hopefully that is enough if not I would drive over to the liquor store and get another. This weekend will be different though.

Not sure what to post. Have lurked here forever even as I drank. Last Sunday I got arrested for being drunk and raising hell at my house. I have 3 small kids and am married. I was in jail for 5 days, including Xmas day. I am facing 2 felonies and my wife filed for a legal separation while I was locked up. This isn't the first time something like this has happened and I think she had enough of this bullshit.

I go to the liquor store and buy a half pint of Long Island. I'm not as excited about it as I usually am but I buy it anyway. I get home crack open the bottle put it up to my lips and then something clicks. Before I can take that one sip that I've been craving I run to the kitchen to pour it out. The bottle is empty. The drink is down the drain.

There is no doubt I want to quit. I absolutely hate drinking. Well you know, till that second that I don't hate it.then drink.then hate it all over again. My biggest fear in committing to quit drinking forever is the incessant claims of "once an addict always an addict" and "you'll never stop craving alcohol". Of course I will try to quit despite that, but how true are those statements? When I make it to 2 weeks, am I going to be going insane trying to stop the cravings? 30 days? A year?. I am currently sitting in a car at the side of the road next to a bar my SO is in. I realize this was probably a mistake. I am covering for her still. I have been doing this for three years. After waiting outside, she tries to get me to come in. I got in serious trouble taking her to the ER to detox just two weeks ago and she's hella drunk. She was supposed to go to an AA meeting. I made the right call. I can't love her into getting better. I can't watch this any more. I'm a 34 year old father of two. I've been drinking since the age of 16. My father is an alcoholic, as was his mother and her biological mother/grandfather. The roots run deep. I picked up 5 x 500 ml cans of beer last night. Summer is always the worst for me, the warm patio weather and sunshine makes me crave a cold drink. I woke up this morning with one of the worst hangovers I've ever had. I had a pounding headache, and I was nauseous, bloated and weak for several hours.

I am not exactly how to answer this question as theres a lot of different types of brain damage in a sense and often times it is not permanent. I do not have the sources to back up my stab at this so take it as you will. I would think alcohol would be harsher on the brain then cocaine. Cocaine may be more cardio toxic and worse in a lot of different ways but I think alcohol wins in the worse for the brain. Alcohol dehydrates you and appears to be more toxic for your liver and other organs I am new to this sub and I already have been reading so many posts and comments that feel like the words were taken out of my mouth. Anyway, I am the type of person who once I decide to make a change, I try and do it all at once. Decided to lose weight three years ago, lost 100 pounds and got in shape. Decided to stop smoking six years ago, literally pulled into a Walgreens parking lot and threw out my cigarettes and lighters. Fast forward to this past Monday. I woke up still buzzed and feeli. so, here i am again. Just turned 2 days, again  I did okay for a bit, then fell down in the muck, again. One night of binge drinking, because of crappy circumstances and crappy feelings and then the typical crappy shame, guilt, and frustration WITH the crappy hangover and withdrawals. but I AM NOT going to let alcohol win. I am going to clean up and get back up on my horse 'til it don't buck no more. Alcohol did not change the circumstances or my feelings, yet even tonight i had really. Hey guys, I am back at Day 2 today, and needing some motivation. Last week when I made it to late in Day 3 before having a drink, Day 3 felt awesome. I was happy, could feel some energy coming back, and i just felt. different. Then I let the alcohol win. I'm on Day 2 again today, and Wednesdays are hard for me because they are usually my drinking days. Big motivation for me to quit drinking is just to know what it feels like to be sober -- to know that sobriety can make me feel better Got a bunch of vodka for low carb drinking, drank it all, wasn't enough, now struggling between carbs and wanting more alcohol. Alcohol wins, beer here. Moral of the story? Buy more vodka. First person to name my personal favorite alcohol win's the best goalie in the game!!!! Happy 4th Xbox one edit!!! one guess. 
The protein bars available in most gas stations are a joke. The ones I saw had 30+ carbs in them and many more calories. I have been skipping lunch and having a small protein snack before working out in the evenings, but today I forgot my shake :( I found these cheese sticks at the local Speedway (https://imgur.com/a/YiWrU) If you can't read the image its 160 calories, 12g fat, 2g carbs, 0 fiber.

I ended up drinking a 26oz in under 2 hours, ended up a pub downtown where I drank much more and the completely blacked out. I have some marks and small scabs on my head guess I fell down somewhere. I came out of the black out for a moment at my front door in the apartment hallway as a neighbor woke me up, guess the lock was too difficult to use :( and according to my roommate puked for a very long time. What a terrible feeling waking up and not knowing what happened. I'm just not "cool" anymore to my friends. I can't stand drinking copious amounts of alcohol anymore. I show up, and I just wish I was at home reading a book with the dog curled up beside me. It's not that I don't ever drink or like to go out, but it's not that fun anymore. I've done it, repeatedly, for about a decade. I look at the drink prices and think of the cab fare (and possibly even the drunk food), and that's a really nice day trip somewhere or an experience I really So today was pretty f cking eventful. First, obligatory backstory: My best friend and I often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it’s a lot of fun when everyone’s enjoying themselves and letting loose. One weekend, my best friend’s older brother came home from Croatia ( First time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. He offers me if I want to come but I want them to have quality bro time so I pass, truly wanting
