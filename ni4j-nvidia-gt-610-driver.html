Что имеем: ноутбук depo vip p 9710 с nvidia 9800 m gt. 02.01.2013 года гамаю в wc3 (dota). Вдруг изображение начинает мерцать…. My computer has an issue that it randomly freezes. I've faced this issue for years across Ubuntu versions and Windows versions. I'm currently running Ubuntu 19.04. I've faced this issue with 16.04, Windows 10 and Windows 7. Is there a tool that I can use to diagnose the problem? Phoronix Output: PROCESSOR: Intel Core i7 930 @ 2.79GHz Core Count: 4 Thread Count: 8 Extensions: Настройка Майнинга Zcash, как майнить zcash на видеокартах gpu nvidia geforce, amd radeon. I know I've already posted about this but I've got more info now. It barely connects to the internet. I've narrowed down the issue. - It is not a drivers issue. - Not adapter issue, I've used three and the same issue happened on all. - Not an OS issue, upgraded to 8.1. - Not a router issue. Really hoping it's not a motherboard issue. Any help? Windows 8.1 Nvidia Gt 610 AMD A8-5500 gt 36 так было написано в майнере, а вообще этот параметр обязателен и на что он влияет. r720 running proxmox. 2x 2650v1 100gb of ram. Trying to passthrough a gt 630. I am following this (https://forum.proxmox.com/threads/gpu-passthrough-tutorial-reference.34303/) guide. I have enabled vt-d on my bios, set it to uefi.

Не секрет, что понять, насколько та или иная видеокарта быстрее и лучше - очень не просто. 
I'm trying to replace some parts of my pc but the thing is that I'm scared of the fact that I might buy something and it might not even work or it is incompatible with my PC mostly because of the fact that I don't know anything about computers, my current budget is 150 dollars so I'm not looking to play games on ultra at 120 FPS, mostly at medium settings at 40 to 50 FPS, I'm going to put my specs down here (it's really old tho) amp#x200B; Hopefully, I don't sound rude or spoiled when askin. Здравствуйте, не могу определиться между начинкой ноутбука Lenovo Ideapad 700-15. Хотелось бы конечно все максимально лучшее, но упираюсь в опеределенный бюджет. I am trying to play some games (cs go, paladins, warface) but the games keep crashing after a while during gameplay or loading screens, I tried to contact support but they all blame my hardware and say to update my graphic card drivers. Is it really relevant?? My pc spec are bad, but not too bad, the games worked in the past (somr last week, and some years ago), but now they always crash. Even on the lowest settings. wtf is going on? I haven't changed anything recently. I also can't update. Оперативная память.

I just beat Dark Souls II:SOTFS and I absolutely loved it, however, I wanted to try my hand at more souls games. I decided to get DSIII and DSR and I assumed that they would run fine, considering DSII ran at a near consistent 45 fps at lower settings. However. thats not the case. I've been having huge issues with framerate in both DSIII and DSR. When I have all the settings at normal as well as a 720p resolution, the average fps is around 9 and peaks at around 16. So I decided. About 3-4 years ago I bought a Prebuilt, CyberPowerPC. It got the job done for what I needed while on a student budget. Now I am looking to upgrade my graphics card. I am a noob when it comes to PCs as I did not build this one and it was my first good PC. Any help will be great.

I'm having two, or more, problems since switching to Ubuntu. On paper they seem unrelated but the behaviors are so similar that my gut looks for a related cause. The two that stand out are the mouse and network connection. The mouse freezes constantly. Usually it starts again. sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes it turns off completely. Unplugging usually gets it going again. The internet connection behaves just like the mouse. Sometimes pausing. Sometimes completely stopping. ampnbsp; Added support for the following GPU: Quadro P4000 with Max-Q Design Fixed an intermittent hang when using Vulkan to present directly to display with the VK_KHR_display extension.

Help please. I don't know what to do anymore. After I updated to 1803 through Windows Update, I noticed any windowed game I played. I have been having problems with audio crackling and sound doubling so I recently went 18.1 -gt 18.3 via update. The problem is occuring more frequently, perhaps every 5 minutes. This occurs on either output. I am wondering if the issue is with my audio software or maybe a problem with a curcuit.

Hi, i recently installed Solus on top of my ubuntu install by erasing the disk. It was fine until i actually booted, it wasn't appearing the boot manager, it was just booting from Solus automatically, i think it was a problem with GRUB still being installed on the ESP partion. One thing i noticed is that Solus, unlike Ubuntu, doesn't has vmlinuz and initrd on the root directory and whenever i would boot from the actual drive it would start grub in rescue mode, and the boot/ directory is totally. ampnbsp; ampnbsp; - Added the ability to over- and under-clock certain GeForce GPUs in the GeForce GTX 1000 series and later. - For GPUs that allow it, an offset can be applied to clock values in some clock domains of all performance levels. - This clock manipulation is done at the user's own risk.

Hello everyone. This is a really strange problem I'm experiencing. Seen from the title the problem is "brightness flickering"(how i call it). So I got a used Lenovo L2240pwD but the condition is like 9/10 if I had to rate it. To explain how it looks like imagine those light switches where you can adjust the brightness of the light. Now imagine just moving it from maximum to minimum and vice versa at the speed of a bullet and stare at the light. Sadly, this "brightness flickering" isn't. https://developer.nvidia.com/opengl-driver OpenGL Driver Support Windows driver version 369.00 and Linux drivers version 367.36.02 provide beta support for OpenGL 2016 ARB extensions on capable hardware.
