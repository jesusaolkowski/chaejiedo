From: Ezequiel Garcia This driver is currently broken, refusing to initialize properly. The reason is that get_nand_dev_by_index() was being called before nand_register(), thus returning a pointer into uninitialized memory. OK, I have this 1532 AP that the IOS got fried or corrupted on. I have been messing with this for a few hours. Found a helpful process to fix it on the cisco forums but I can't get the IOS to upload via TFTP. My main issue is that I keep getting "PERMISSION DENIED" after I enter the tar command line to get the file from the tftp server(laptop). I have all firewalls turned off, both are on the same subnet. I can watch the connection being established on the SolarWinds TFTP server Best Answer: NAND refers to the type of flash memory. There are two types, NAND and NOR. NAND is cheaper, and therefore more common. You have a partitioning, or memory hardware problem. If the problem is with partitioning, usually some form of JTAG is required HI, I have an ER-X router, running v 2.0.1, and I've noticed that it reboots once a week (Saturday morning in my case) with no apparent reason. I've configured it to send logs to a Linux machine in my network, but i can't seem to find something wrong there. however, the only thing i did noticed, is the time and date change to a day earlier (although ntp is configured properly), and the log file is starting with kernel messages from Nov 3rd. anyone here experienced something similar?.

After a minute or two it resolves itself. amp#x200B; The usual trigger for this is browsing in chrome and using certain java applications. It doesn't matter how many tabs are open or what load the computer is under. It seems random. amp#x200B; The result is all apps freezing/crashing for minutes at a time. All Disk activity goes blank.

Hey, everyone. I've been pretty busy recently, so I haven't been posting on reddit about the videos as I've been releasing them like I usually try to do. My most recent videos have been around how to install RGH 1.2 on a Jasper 360.

Hey Techsupport! My girlfriend recently upgraded her PC and now every game crashes randomly. One of the games (Final Fantasy 14) gives an error message when it crashes saying it's related to Direct X 11. While other games, like Sekiro, gives no error message. We assumed it was a driver issue or a GPU issue but she's done a clean install of different drivers as well as tried to use her old GPU(which didn't cause any crashes in her old build) in the new build but games are still crashing to deskt.
